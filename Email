Subject: **Action Required: Review of Aged Content in SharePoint Environments**

Dear SharePoint Information Owners,

I hope this message finds you well.

We are reaching out to inform you of a recent scan conducted across our SharePoint environments. The results have indicated a significant volume of items that have not been modified or accessed for over **13 months**.

**Key Findings:**
- A high number of items aged beyond the 13-month threshold.
- An accumulation of untouched items, suggesting a review of current usage is necessary.
- Potential to optimize storage and improve system performance by addressing these concerns.

**Action Items:**
1. **Reduce File Count:** We encourage you to review and purge any unnecessary files that are no longer relevant to business operations.
2. **Untouched Items:** Please assess the untouched items in your store to determine if they should be archived or deleted.
3. **Retention Period:** Consider reducing the retention period for certain locations to align with our data governance policies and reduce digital clutter.

We understand that managing digital content can be challenging, and we are here to support you in this process. To assist with this initiative, we will be providing tools and resources to help you efficiently identify and manage aged content.

Your prompt attention to this matter is crucial in maintaining an efficient and compliant digital environment. Please ensure to complete the review and necessary actions by [insert deadline].

For any questions or assistance, feel free to reach out to the IT support team.

Thank you for your cooperation and commitment to improving our SharePoint management.
