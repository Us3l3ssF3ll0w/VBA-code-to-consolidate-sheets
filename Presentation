What are the risks associated with not recertifying a shared mailbox 

Here are some of the risks associated with not recertifying a shared mailbox:

Security Risks: Not recertifying shared mailboxes can result in unauthorized access to sensitive information, potentially putting the organization's data at risk.

Data Loss: Recertification helps to maintain an accurate and up-to-date list of users who have access to the shared mailbox. Failing to recertify can lead to the removal of users who still need access, potentially causing data loss.

Compliance Issues: In regulated industries, not recertifying shared mailboxes could result in non-compliance with regulations, leading to legal and financial consequences.

Inefficient Usage: Not recertifying shared mailboxes can result in outdated or incorrect information about users, leading to miscommunication and inefficiencies in the usage of the shared mailbox.

Overloading: If the list of users with access to a shared mailbox is not regularly reviewed and updated, it can result in an excessive number of users accessing the mailbox, leading to overloading and decreased efficiency.

Lack of Organization: Without regular recertification, the list of users with access to a shared mailbox may become disorganized, leading to difficulties in managing and tracking shared mailbox usage.
